## 00
- Remember strings should be in single quotes
- WHERE col IN () lets you provide a list to check if the col value is in it
- 7/7

## 01
- Cakewalk when you've learnt a bit of regex lol
- CONCAT(col, string) concatenates, weirdly enough
    - importantly, that lets you use col values in LIKE by concatenating them with '%'
- REPLACE(string, string to replace, string replacement)
    - does what the syntax says, you can pass col_names as long as they're strings

## 02
- **NO SPACES IN NUMBERS!!!**
- XOR is a thing, shows rows where one of the two conditions are true but not both
- length(col) gives you the length of the value in col
- can use <> as not equals in some SQL variants?
- 6/7 on the test
    - WHERE filters before any math in the select 

## 03
- You can escape single quotes (') by doing 2 of them (O''Neill)
- You can chain ORDER BY using commas
- IN () can be used as a value; it returns 1 if there's a match and 0 if not
